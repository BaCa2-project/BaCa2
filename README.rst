BaCa2 Project
=============

**BaCa2** is an automated, online code checking system for programming tasks. It is currently being developed for the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of the Jagiellonian University in Cracow, Poland. The system aims to ensure simplicity and ease of use while allowing for significant complexity of both the programming tasks and solution checking methods.

BaCa2 is currently being developed by a team of four UJ students:
Bartosz Deptu≈Ça,
Izabela Golec,
Mateusz Kadula,
Krzysztof Kalita
